            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Biodiversity in marine ecosystems refers to the variety and variability of life forms within oceanic and sea environments. This includes the range of species, genetic diversity, and ecosystem diversity found within marine habitats. Marine biodiversity is crucial for the health and stability of the planet's ecosystems, providing numerous ecological, economic, and cultural benefits.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Species Diversity</h2>
            <p>
                Marine ecosystems are home to a vast array of species, ranging from microscopic plankton to the largest whales. This diversity is categorized into different groups, including:
            </p>
            <div class="species-box">
                <h3>Phytoplankton and Zooplankton</h3>
                <p>
                    Phytoplankton are microscopic plants that form the base of the marine food web through photosynthesis. Zooplankton, including small animals and larvae, feed on phytoplankton and are, in turn, consumed by larger marine animals.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="species-box">
                <h3>Marine Invertebrates</h3>
                <p>
                    This group includes a wide variety of species such as mollusks, crustaceans, and coral polyps. They play essential roles in nutrient cycling, habitat formation, and as prey for other marine animals.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="species-box">
                <h3>Fish</h3>
                <p>
                    Fish are one of the most diverse groups in marine ecosystems, with thousands of species adapted to different habitats and ecological niches. They are vital for commercial fisheries and as a food source for humans and other marine creatures.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="species-box">
                <h3>Marine Mammals</h3>
                <p>
                    Marine mammals, including whales, dolphins, and seals, are top predators in the ocean. They play significant roles in maintaining the balance of marine ecosystems and are often indicators of environmental health.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="species-box">
                <h3>Marine Birds</h3>
                <p>
                    Many bird species, such as penguins, albatrosses, and gulls, are adapted to life in marine environments. They contribute to the biodiversity of marine ecosystems and are essential for nutrient cycling and energy flow.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Genetic Diversity</h2>
            <p>
                Genetic diversity refers to the variety of genes within and between species in marine ecosystems. It is crucial for the adaptability and resilience of species to environmental changes and stressors. High genetic diversity within a species enhances its ability to survive diseases, adapt to climate change, and maintain overall ecosystem health.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Ecosystem Diversity</h2>
            <p>
                Marine ecosystems encompass a wide range of habitats, each with its unique assemblage of species and ecological processes. Some of the key marine ecosystems include:
            </p>
            <div class="ecosystem-box">
                <h3>Coral Reefs</h3>
                <p>
                    Coral reefs are among the most diverse and productive ecosystems on Earth. They provide habitat for thousands of marine species and offer protection to coastal areas from erosion and storms.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="ecosystem-box">
                <h3>Mangroves</h3>
                <p>
                    Mangrove forests are coastal wetlands found in tropical and subtropical regions. They serve as nurseries for many marine species and protect shorelines from erosion.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="ecosystem-box">
                <h3>Seagrass Meadows</h3>
                <p>
                    Seagrass meadows are underwater habitats formed by seagrass plants. They provide food and shelter for a variety of marine life and contribute to water quality and carbon sequestration.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="ecosystem-box">
                <h3>Deep-Sea Ecosystems</h3>
                <p>
                    The deep sea is a vast and largely unexplored part of the ocean, characterized by extreme conditions. It hosts unique species adapted to high pressure, low temperatures, and darkness, and plays a critical role in global nutrient cycling.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Conservation of Marine Biodiversity</h2>
            <p>
                Protecting marine biodiversity is essential for the health and sustainability of the planet. Conservation efforts include the establishment of marine protected areas, sustainable fisheries management, habitat restoration, and addressing threats such as pollution, climate change, and overfishing. International cooperation and policy frameworks, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, play crucial roles in these efforts.
