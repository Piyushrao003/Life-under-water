        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The ocean covers over 70% of the planet and is vital for human survival. It regulates our climate, produces oxygen, and supports a vast array of marine life. Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14), also known as "Life Below Water," aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development. The health of the ocean is critical for the well-being of both marine and human life.
        </p>
        <p>
            SDG 14 targets a range of issues such as reducing marine pollution, protecting marine and coastal ecosystems, regulating fishing practices, and increasing scientific knowledge to improve ocean health. Achieving these targets requires global cooperation and sustainable practices at all levels of society.
        </p>
        <h2>Why SDG 14 Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Oceans play a crucial role in supporting life on Earth. They absorb about 30% of the carbon dioxide produced by humans, buffer the impacts of climate change, and provide food and livelihoods for billions of people. However, human activities such as overfishing, pollution, and climate change are severely impacting ocean health. By addressing these challenges through SDG 14, we can ensure the sustainability of marine resources for future generations.
        </p>
        <h2>Key Targets of SDG 14</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, particularly from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution.</li>
            <li>By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration.</li>
            <li>Minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels.</li>
            <li>By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, and destructive fishing practices.</li>
            <li>By 2020, conserve at least 10% of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Challenges and Opportunities</h2>
        <p>
            Despite the importance of oceans, they are often overlooked in environmental and policy discussions. Challenges such as lack of awareness, inadequate funding, and insufficient enforcement of regulations hinder progress towards achieving SDG 14. However, there are also significant opportunities for positive change through innovative technologies, stronger policies, and increased public engagement.
        </p>
        <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
        <p>
            Everyone has a role to play in protecting our oceans. Simple actions such as reducing plastic use, supporting sustainable seafood, and participating in beach clean-ups can make a difference. Additionally, advocating for policies that protect marine environments and raising awareness about the importance of ocean conservation are crucial steps towards achieving SDG 14.
