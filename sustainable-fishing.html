            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Sustainable fishing practices are essential for maintaining healthy marine ecosystems and ensuring that fish populations remain abundant for future generations. This approach seeks to balance the ecological health of marine environments with the economic needs of fishing communities.

                    <h3>Ecological Balance</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sustainable fishing aims to maintain the ecological balance of marine ecosystems. This includes ensuring that fish stocks are harvested at levels that do not exceed their capacity to regenerate and maintaining the health of marine habitats.

                    <h3>Minimizing Bycatch</h3>
                    <p>
                        Bycatch refers to non-target species that are unintentionally caught during fishing operations. Sustainable fishing practices focus on reducing bycatch through the use of selective fishing gear and techniques to minimize the impact on non-target species.

                    <h3>Protecting Marine Habitats</h3>
                    <p>
                        Protecting marine habitats such as coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass beds is crucial for sustaining fish populations and overall marine health. Sustainable fishing practices include measures to avoid damaging these important ecosystems.
